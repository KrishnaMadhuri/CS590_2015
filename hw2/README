The date utility program displays the current date in the desired format.
Modifications made:
I have modified the current default date by adding wishes to the user.
And i also created an additional option -c to the date command, which displays wishes to the logged in user and also displays the full weekday to the user.
This additional option -c has been also added in the man pages for date command.
